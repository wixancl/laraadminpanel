# Official Documentation
To get started with Generator, use Composer to add the package to your project's dependencies:

`composer require bvipul/generator ^5.6`

Since you would be having work of this generator, while creating your project, hence only require it in the dev environment.

### Configuration

After installing the Generator, register the `Bvipul\Generator\Provider\CrudGeneratorServiceProvider` in your `config/app.php` configuration file:

```php
'providers' => [
    // Other service providers...

    Bvipul\Generator\Provider\CrudGeneratorServiceProvider::class
],
```

If you need to change what the stubs are generating for you, you can always publish the package's views files by below command:
```
php artisan vendor:publish --tag=generator_views
```

and you can get the title "Module Management" from package's translation file by using:

```
{{ trans('generator::menus.modules.management') }}
```
